## Ethereum - A Blockchain Playground

This repo is a playground that serve me as an exploration of the blockchain via [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/), [Web3 JS API](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API), [Parity](https://www.parity.io/), [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) and [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/).

The files contain basic Solidity Smart contracts, [ERC20 Tokens](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard), and other contracts and utilities. All of these with their respective scripts that interact with the contracts via Web3 JS API.

Most of these files and contracts are based on the book [Ethereum, tokens & smart contracts.: Notes on getting started](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078CQ8L7V) by Eugenio Noyola.
